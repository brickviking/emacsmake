#
# v0.1 Initial cut, should be mostly complete.
# v0.2 Changes to account for mistakes I made.
# v0.3 rework of environment variables.
# v0.4 added distclean, maintainerclean, and run everything.
# v0.5 Renamed reference from emacs-sandbox to with-emacs as upstream has renamed.
# v0.6 Finally added link to with-emacs.sh - it's about time.
#      Added comment for checking number of args at runtime.
# v0.7 Added in a do-almost-all (clean, configure, make).
# v0.8 Added some commented out options (lucid and motif).
# v0.8.1 Twiddled with config, error's only in the docs.
# v0.8.2 fixed docs for config with ugly hack.
# v0.9 Planning install upgrade to symlink the emacs binary to emacs-${VER}-$[WMGR}
# v0.10 Reworked all the pushd/popd to be quiet, by redirecting their output to /dev/null.
# v0.11 Created new param to combine make and install, deliberately doesn't include config.
# v0.12 Begin process of pulling in vars from environment if already provided.
# v0.13 Now we've got the main x-toolkit targets, how about --without-x?
# v0.14 We're adding makeAllToolkits, and makeMeBootstrap
#
# TODO: rework for versions of Emacs earlier than 28.0.50, as there's no makefile until the
#       configure phase. Still doesn't work for much earlier than 23 - 18.59 has no configure.
